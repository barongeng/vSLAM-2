Summary: This project is not at the moment intended for usage by anyone other,
than me.


Do not get me wrong, I am not discouraging
anyone. The code itself is quite fine, not too messy or anything. At least
not the Haskell part. But I am quite sure, that to setup the build
process correctly is gonna be quite a pain.

I am gonna have it all cleaned up by the end of the May 2014 (that's the deadline).
So do not waste any time on this project yet. It IS gonna get better :-)

Moreover, there are some issues (not in the tracker), that are rather annoying,
and that nobody else than me can probably sort out (maybe not even discover).
And they're gonna prove a pain-in-the-ass for anybody stumbling upon them.

Seriously, you got better things to do :D

Have a nice day,
Pavel
